I feel that the best way to achieve this goal is through this blog. The process of creating this blog through `Distill` for `R` and subsequently porting the blog to `Quarto`, has taught me a great deal. I plan to explore data sets, create data visualizations, and thoroughly analyze questions that interest me using the R language. Anything that I learn that is worth sharing will be compiled here as a blog post or a series of blog posts. Please join me in my journey through `R` and data analysis and feel free to join in, offer advice or ask questions of your own that arise from this blog. Details on the resources that help me along this journey and ways to stay in touch with me are included below.\n\n## It Takes A Village\n\nThis blog and everything I do in it would not be possible with out the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) community and the many people within it that share their hard work so that others may learn. There are too many people to thank and highlight individually for their guidance and inspiration, so I encourage you to explore the depths on your own. Nonetheless, I will attempt to keep a running list of people and resources that have helped me along my journey:\n\n-   Thomas Mock's [The Mockup Blog](https://themockup.blog/) - great resource for launching a Distill blog, using images in plots and tables and so much more\n-   The fantasy football Twitter community - so many great people are putting out great work that inspired me to get back into R\n    -   nflfastR by [Ben Baldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) and [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/mrcaseb) has inspired some awesome NFL data visualizations and analysis\n    -   One particular project that inspired me was [Josh Hornsby](https://twitter.com/Josh_ADHD)'s awesome Shiny App for the annual Scott Fish Bowl (check out [Fantasy Cares](https://fantasycares.net/))\n-   The R community puts out amazing documentation on just about anything you can think of.
