    "text": "The most exciting aspect of sports (in my opinion) is watching players score. Even die-hard fans of great defense must admit that the excitement of a defensive stop comes from preventing an opposing player from scoring. A high powered offense is a sight to be seen. In free-flowing sports scores can come from excellent individual effort, precision passing leading to a catch and score, or as is often the case a combination of the two.\nToday we are going to focus on passing. Specifically, assists or the successful passes that lead directly to a score. When watching free-flowing sports such as basketball, hockey and lacrosse, fans will be well aware of the players that execute passes which make it possible for other players to score. An observant fan may take note of which players have a particularly productive passing-scoring relationship throughout a game or a season. An even deeper level of fan may wonder how players and teams work together through passing to scoring. Then to take it a step further ask questions such as how effective are these scoring relationships? And, how do they grow and develop throughout a game/season either based on team philosophy, chemistry or matchups?\nFor those fans…allow me to introduce you to Assist Networks."

    "text": "Gather and Clean Data\nWhile a Lacrosee Reference PRO subscription does not grant you direct database access, it does give you the next best thing - a GUI to query their database! So, we head over to Lacrosse Reference to grab all our data. For this exercise we are focused on the 2022 season. So we will download the CSV files for players, teams, games and assists data from both Men’s and Women’s DI Lacrosse for the 2022 season and bring them into our R session (please note for the purposes of this post we are only using a partial data pull).\n\nplayers_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/data_players_2022.csv\")\nteams_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/data_teams.csv\")\ngames_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/data_games_2022.csv\")\nassist_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/data_assists_2022.csv\")\n\nSince this data is taken from a database, we need to clean it up a bit. The data is scrapped from the NCAA play by play logs and therefore has some imperfections. A major imperfection is that some records are duplicated; therefore, we must be sure to filter them out. We will use the players, teams and games data to “de-code” the player, team and game id’s in the assist data so we can easily access the assist data we want for our network.\n\n#clean up player data into player list with player_id\n# cahnge player name from full name to first initial last name for plot labeling purposes\nplayers_data &lt;- players_data %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  rename(player_id = id) %&gt;% \n  separate(player, into = c(\"player_first\", \"player_last\"), extra = \"merge\", sep = \" \") %&gt;% \n  mutate(player = paste0(str_sub(player_first, start = 1, end = 1), \". \", player_last)) %&gt;% \n  select(player, player_id)\n#clean up teams data \nteams_data &lt;- teams_data %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  rename(team_id = id) %&gt;% \n  select(-league)\n#clean up games data with help of teams data\ngames_data &lt;- games_data %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  rename(game_id = id) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., teams_data, by = c(\"home_id\" = \"team_id\")) %&gt;% #add home team name, etc.\n  rename(home_team_short = short_code, home_team = display_name) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., teams_data, by = c(\"away_id\" = \"team_id\")) %&gt;% #add away team name, etc.\n  rename(away_team_short = short_code, away_team = display_name)\n#clean up assist data using clean players, teams and games data\nassist_data &lt;- assist_data %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  left_join(., players_data, by = c(\"shooter_id\" = \"player_id\")) %&gt;% #add shooter name\n  rename(shooter = player) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., players_data, by = c(\"assister_id\" = \"player_id\")) %&gt;% #add assister name\n  rename(assister = player) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., games_data, by = \"game_id\") %&gt;% \n  distinct() #verify that no duplicates are in the data\n\nNow that we have clean assist data for both leagues for the 2022 season, we can begin to construct an assist network plot. The question now is how to select a game of interest. There a variety of factors that go into an “interesting” game for assist data. Maybe you are clamoring for me to choose a game that involves your favorite team, or one your favorite players performed particularly well in or perhaps you have a specific question you want answered with data. All of these are great ideas and assist networks can meet all of those desires and more. For the purposes of this demo we are going to look for a game with many assists and assister-shooter combinations so we can see the full power of an assist network.

    "section": "Create Network Object",
    "text": "Create Network Object\nOur data is clean. We have selected the game and the team we would like to analyze the assist network for. Let’s create our network object using the igraph package.\n\nlibrary(igraph)\n\nA network object consists of two major pieces: nodes and links. For the purpose of assist networks, our nodes will be players that were either the assister or shooter in the assist interactions and our links will represent the frequency of those interactions between two players.\nLet’s gather our network data by filtering our clean assist data to only the records for Penn from the Penn vs. Princeton game on March 19th, 2022.\n\n#we take the game id from our away_game_assist_info tbl and select only Penn records\npenn_ntwk_data &lt;- assist_data %&gt;% \n  filter(game_id == 10259 & team_id == away_id)\n\nNow we are ready to create our network nodes and links!\n\nNetwork Nodes\nThe nodes of a network (also referred to as vertices) serve as the beginning points or endpoints (or both) of the interaction you are analyzing. In the case of an assist interaction, nodes are defined as either the player scoring the goal (shooter) or the player that is credited with the assist (assister). Therefore, we want our nodes dataframe to include all players that were either assisters or shooters in the game with no duplicates. When creating our nodes dataframe, we want the first column to consist of all node IDs (assisters/shooters) and all subsequent columns can contain node attributes. In this case our node attributes include:\n\nnum_interactions - the number of interactions for a player. We define this as the number of assisted scoring plays the player is a part of, which is also the sum of their assists and goals (referred to as points in lacrosse).\nnum_assists - the number of assists a player recorded in the game.\nplayer_name - the player name associated with the node. In our case this column is a duplicate of the node id column. This is necessary to use the player’s name as both a node id and a node attribute.\n\nThis node dataframe contains the information we need to begin building the network as well as some key attributes that will add context to our network visualization. Below is the code to create the network nodes dataframe:\n\npenn_cnt_assists &lt;- penn_ntwk_data %&gt;% \n  select(assister) %&gt;% \n  count(assister) %&gt;% \n  rename(num_assists = n)\n     \npenn_ntwk_nodes &lt;- penn_ntwk_data %&gt;% \n  select(assister, shooter) %&gt;% #need to have all shooters/assisters listed as vertices\n  pivot_longer(everything(), values_to = \"assister_shooter\") %&gt;% \n  select(-name) %&gt;% \n  count(assister_shooter) %&gt;% \n  rename(num_interactions = n) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., penn_cnt_assists, by = c(\"assister_shooter\" = \"assister\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(num_assists = replace_na(num_assists, 0)) %&gt;%         \n  distinct() %&gt;%         \n  mutate(player_name = assister_shooter)        \n\nNetwork Nodes are ready to go! Time to link them up.\n\n\nNetwork Links\nThe links of a network show how the nodes connect (or don’t connect) to each other. Network links can be directed (typically with an arrow to denote where link starts and ends) or un-directed, based on the nature of the interaction being described. For our assist network, we want to show which node is the assister and which node is the shooter. The link starting at the assister and ending with an arrow pointing to the shooter, provides a logical visual representation of the assist interaction. Within a game environment, it is not uncommon that players would classified as both an assister and a shooter. So, we expect to see two-way interactions in our networks (this also adds another layer of analysis to observe the amount of two-way interactions or lack thereof). In the case that two players assisted each other, the link will be shown with an arrow on each end to indicate each player received an assist from the other.\nIt is common that a player may assist another player multiple times over the course of a game. When we go to visualize these, we can choose to either show a link for every connection between the two players or show the link once and add a label to show the number of times the link occurred. We will go the route of showing a link with a number denoting the frequency in order to have a cleaner looking visualization. Therefore, we want to create a dataframe that shows each assister-shooter combination with the frequency of each. Since it is redundant to label links that only occur once, we will set the label to blank when frequency is one. Now, we are ready to create our network links dataframe. Similarly to our network links dataframe, the first two columns of the network links dataframe will be populated with the network link IDs. The first column should contain the node ID where the link will start, with the second column indicating the node ID at which the link ends. In the case of our assist network the first column will contain all assister node IDs and the second column will contain all shooter node IDs. The subsequent columns in the network links dataframe will be used to store any link attributes that we will need for plotting or analysis. For our assist network we will bring in the following attributes:\n\nassister_shooter_freq - indicates the number of times the assister-shooter combination occurred within the game being analyzed.\nassister_shooter_freq_label - takes the number of times the assister-shooter combination occurred within the game and replaces any frequencies equal to one with a blank. This will be used to label each link and avoids unnecessary labeling.\n\nBelow is the code to create the network nodes dataframe:\n\npenn_assister_shooter_combo &lt;- penn_ntwk_data %&gt;%\n  select(assister, shooter) %&gt;%\n  count(assister, shooter) %&gt;%\n  rename(assister_shooter_freq = n) \n\npenn_ntwk_links &lt;- penn_ntwk_data %&gt;%\n  select(assister, shooter) %&gt;% #gather all connections between assisters and shooters\n  left_join(., penn_assister_shooter_combo, by = c(\"assister\", \"shooter\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(assister_shooter_freq_label = \n           if_else(assister_shooter_freq == 1, \"\", \n                   as.character(assister_shooter_freq)))\n\nNetwork Links are ready to go! Now we can create our network object.\n\n\nNodes + Links = Network\nNow that we have prepared our network nodes and links, our network object can be created. This is where the igraph package comes in. We will use the igraph::graph_from_data_frame() function to form the network object. The network links dataframe is supplied to the d argument and the network nodes dataframe to the vertices argument. As discussed in the network links section, we want to show the direction of our network links so we set the directed argument to TRUE.\n\npenn_ntwk &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(d=penn_ntwk_links, vertices=penn_ntwk_nodes, directed=T) \n\nOur network is ready to be plotted!"

    "section": "Plot Network",
    "text": "Plot Network\nSo far, we have * brought in our assist data * chosen a game to analyze * prepared the data * created our igraph network object.\nWe can now plot our network and see the assist network for Penn during the Princeton-Penn game from March 19th, 2022. There is network graphing functionality contained within the igraph package (helpful tutorial is here). However, I am an avid fan of the tidyverse who is used to and comfortable with ggplot2 and the ability to build plots layer by layer. So, I was delighted to discover the ggraph package that is designed to bring the same flexible approach to building up plots layer by layer and apply it to visualizing networks. For the purposes of this post, we will be plotting our network with ggraph. I recommend exploring the plotting mechanisms in igraph as well if you have the time.\n\nlibrary(ggraph)\n\nUsers of ggplot2 will find the following method of building our plot layer by layer familiar and comfortable. For those not as familiar, I expect it will also be relatively easy to follow along with and will hopefully inspire you to dive head first into the R/tidyverse pool. Our plot will be composed of the following layers:\n\nBase Layer - plot object using ggraph::ggraph()\nNode Layer - using ggraph::geom_node_point()\nLinks Layer - using ggraph::geom_edge_arc()\nNode Label Layer - using ggraph::geom_node_text()\nStyling Layer - using common ggplot2 styling functions\n\nThe only network specific data attributes we are missing in our network object are the colors that we want our nodes and links to be in the plot. We will use the teamcolors package to provide the hexcodes for Penn’s primary and secondary colors.\n\nBase Layer\nWe begin our netwok plot assembly by initializing the plot with the ggraph() function. Our igraph network object is supplied to the first argument of the function. Then we specify the network plot layout we would like to use. Take a look at the ggraph() documentation for a list of layout options. For our Penn Assist Network plot we chose the “kk” layout from the igraph layout library. The “kk” layout uses the spring-based algorithm by Kamada and Kawai to place nodes. The key requirement for our node layout is that all nodes are well spaced out. After playing with different layouts, the “kk” looked to give us a visually appealing spread of nodes across a variety of assist networks. I encourage you to try a few out and find the one that suits your needs the best.\n\npenn_ntwk_plot &lt;- ggraph(penn_ntwk, layout = \"kk\") \n\npenn_ntwk_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, we see that the initialization of the plot object does not render any actual plot elements. We will add them layer by layer.\n\n\nNode Layer\nNow that our plot object is initialized, we can start adding plot attributes. First, we want to draw in our network nodes using ggraph::geom_node_point(). For the size of the nodes we will use the number of assists the player recorded. Since the number of assists a given player could have in a game is relatively small, we add a weight to the size input. This allows the nodes to be more visible while maintaining the visual indicator of whether a player had more or less assists than other players on their team. We use the filled in circle shape for our node and set the fill color to Penn’s secondary color using the teamcolors package.\n\npenn_ntwk_plot &lt;- ggraph(penn_ntwk, layout = \"kk\") +\n  geom_node_point( # add nodes to the plot\n    aes(size = num_assists + 50),\n    shape = 21,\n    fill = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 2), #sets nodes color to Penn's secondary color\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) \n\npenn_ntwk_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur nodes are now drawn in, put at this point our plot does not show anything useful.\n\n\nLinks Layer\nWith our nodes in place, it is time to draw the links between them using ggraph::geom_edge_arc()! There are a few different geom_edge_* options in the ggraph package. We chose the geom that uses an arced line to draw the links, as this option gave us the cleanest visual. The endpoint of our link will have an arrow on it to help denote the direction of the link, as we have established the importance of that detail in the context of an assist network. The strength of the link refers to the bend of the curve. The color of the link is set to Penn’s primary color using the teamcolors package. Another important detail is the link label, as we have decided to draw a single link between nodes regardless of the number of links that exist between the nodes. Our link label will denote the number of links between the nodes or in our context the number of times player x assisted player y. We will also draw a thicker arc between nodes where there are multiple links to provide a visual context to the relationship between nodes (thicker arc = more assists between players).\n\npenn_ntwk_plot &lt;- ggraph(penn_ntwk, layout = \"kk\") +\n  geom_node_point( # add nodes to the plot\n    aes(size = num_assists + 50),\n    shape = 21,\n    fill = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 2), #sets nodes color to Penn's secondary color\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_edge_arc( #add links to the plot\n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, 'mm'), type = \"closed\"),\n    start_cap = circle(2, 'mm'),\n    end_cap = circle(4, 'mm'),\n    strength = 0.15,\n    color = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 1), #sets links color to Penn's primary color\n    aes(label = assister_shooter_freq_label,\n        edge_width = assister_shooter_freq),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) \n\npenn_ntwk_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow our plot is starting to take shape!\n\n\nNode Label Layer\nOur nodes and our links are drawn in and we can see the shape of our network. However, we have no context on any of our network interactions. We want to know which player assisted which shooter. So, we will use ggraph::geom_node_text() to add labels to our nodes by assigning player names to the label argument. We can specify the size and color of the label as well as the position of the label in relation to the node using nude-x and nudge_y. It takes a bit of trail and error to get the label alignment just right, so that most every label is easy to read and easily marks the correct node.\n\npenn_ntwk_plot &lt;- ggraph(penn_ntwk, layout = \"kk\") +\n  geom_node_point( # add nodes to the plot\n    aes(size = num_assists + 50),\n    shape = 21,\n    fill = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 2), #sets nodes color to Penn's secondary color\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_edge_arc( #add links to the plot\n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, 'mm'), type = \"closed\"),\n    start_cap = circle(2, 'mm'),\n    end_cap = circle(4, 'mm'),\n    strength = 0.15,\n    color = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 1), #sets links color to Penn's primary color\n    aes(label = assister_shooter_freq_label,\n        edge_width = assister_shooter_freq),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_node_text( # add node labels to plot\n    aes(label = player_name),\n    size = 4,\n    color = \"gray50\",\n    #repel = T,\n    nudge_x = -0.05,\n    nudge_y = -0.35\n  ) \n\npenn_ntwk_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur plot now has the necessary context!\n\n\nStyling Layer & Full Plot\nNow that our plot is fully constructed, we want to clean it up a bit. First, we add scales to smooth the look of our nodes and links. Next, we add titles and captions (always cite your data source!) to describe the key details of the plot.\n\npenn_ntwk_plot &lt;- ggraph(penn_ntwk, layout = \"kk\") +\n  geom_node_point( # add nodes to the plot\n    aes(size = num_assists + 50),\n    shape = 21,\n    fill = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 2), #sets nodes color to Penn's secondary color\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_edge_arc( #add links to the plot\n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, 'mm'), type = \"closed\"),\n    start_cap = circle(2, 'mm'),\n    end_cap = circle(4, 'mm'),\n    strength = 0.15,\n    color = teamcolors::team_pal(\"Penn\", 1), #sets links color to Penn's primary color\n    aes(label = assister_shooter_freq_label,\n        edge_width = assister_shooter_freq),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_node_text( # add node labels to plot\n    aes(label = player_name),\n    size = 4,\n    color = \"gray50\",\n    #repel = T,\n    nudge_x = -0.05,\n    nudge_y = -0.35\n  ) +\n  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(1.5, 3)) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(4, 12)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(\n    caption = \"Data: @laxreference | Plot: @danovertoom\",\n    title = \"Penn Assist Network\",\n    subtitle = \"Penn vs.Princeton 2022-03-19\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 22),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\npenn_ntwk_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see that Sam Handley was the focal point of the Penn offense in this game with 3 goals and 8 assists. The Handley-Rubin connection was particularly effective, with Rubin (7G, 2A) scoring 5 times off of Handley passes and resulting in six total assisted goals between the two. Dylan Gregar was the third major offensive contributor (2G, 3A) with all of his points coming from assist interactions.\nNow that our network plot is complete and analyzed, it is ready to be shared! It is common that we would want a PNG image file of the network plot, so it can easily be shared (tweeted). We will use ggsave() to create the file and save it somewhere useful.\n\nggsave(filename = \"plots/penn_princeton_ntwk_2022_03_19.png\", plot = penn_ntwk_plot, dpi = 800)\n\nWith our plot saved, we can now use it pretty much anywhere - like as the preview image for this blog post!"

    "text": "The summer of 2020 was full of many unexpected things. One of the most enjoyable by far was the inaugural season of Fantasy Lacrosse. The Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) was coming off of it’s introductory 2019 season featuring games in 14 different cities across the U.S. and Canada. Like many other sports leagues, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a change of plans for the 2020 season.\nThe PLL opted to play a self contained or “bubble” season dubbed the 2020 PLL Championship Series in Herriman, Utah. This condensed season featured 14 Group Play Games, where each of the seven teams played 4 games followed by a single elimination playoff tournament. The players of the PLL were given an opportunity to compete and the fans were given something to look forward to. The result was two weeks of high quality lacrosse for the world to see. The 2020 Championship Series also provided a window for another first in the lacrosse world: Fantasy Lacrosse.\nThe series of blog posts to follow will review the 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse Season by giving a broad overview of what happened and then dive into the details team by team and position by position.The journey through the 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse season will provide participants a chance to reflect on what strategies worked or didn’t work and all the fun had along the way. For those who didn’t participate in Fantasy Lacrosse in 2020, I hope this series of posts inspires you to form or join a league in 2021 and hit the ground running with a strong base of knowledge."

    "text": "Flow Fantasy\nWith the majority of the world confined in their homes with an itch for something to do, there was a massive opportunity to make a splash in the summer of 2020. Flow Fantasy co-founders Grant Schwartz and Spencer Meyers seized it. Together they brought fantasy lacrosse to the fans by creating the first platform to allow the creation of individual leagues, drafts, trades, free agency acquisitions and pool contests to win prizes. Flow Fantasy partnered with Pro Lacrosse Talk (now under the Lacrosse Playground umbrella) and put together some great articles and a companion podcast to introduce the details of the platform that I encourage you to check out.\nFlow Fantasy brought joy to countless fans (including myself) who love both lacrosse and fantasy sports. Being able to put together a league of your buddies and get together for a draft (albeit via Zoom) complete with hot takes and trash talk is an experience that lacrosse fans have been waiting for. I thoroughly enjoyed previewing the season with some pals while drafting our favorite players to compete and see who put together the ultimate fantasy lacrosse team. None of the members of our league, which consisted of both avid and casual lacrosse fans, knew quite what we were getting ourselves into. But, as the 2020 PLL Championship Series drew to a close everyone was happy to have played as they gained a new appreciation for the game, players and statistics behind it all."

    "text": "Roster Components\nFlow Fantasy provided a choice of two league formats in 2020, with the intention of accommodating leagues of various sizes. One league format option allowed users to create a starting lineup consisting of two attackmen, two midfielders, two defensemen and one alternate player (either a Faceoffmen or Goalie). The second league format allowed a starting lineup of ten players, requiring teams to start both a Faceoffmen and a Goalie while also featuring two FLEX spots in which an Attackmen, Midfielder or Defensemen could be used.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of @FlowFantasyInc\n\n\nThis series of blog posts will focus on the league option that allowed a larger starting roster - because in my opinion starting more players is more fun and with the wealth of talent at every position in the PLL, why not. Considering that this format requires each team to have a Faceoffmen and Goalie on their roster, it follows that leagues should be limited to the number of PLL teams (7 in 2020, 8 in 2021). However, with certain teams utilizing two Faceoffmen and two Goalies in 2020 it is possible to have larger leagues with this format - especially with the influx of talent entering the league in 2021. Regardless, being aware of what roster option your league uses us an important first step in building your ultimate fantasy lacrosse team. In the position by position blog post to follow, we will dive deeper into the best strategies for roster construction."

Then teams set a lineup according to the roster requirements for each week or slate of games. The goal is to set an optimal lineup that will earn your team the most points possible. Players score fantasy points for achieving statistically measurable actions during their games. Flow Fantasy implemented the following scoring system for the 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse season through (images courtesy of @FlowFantasyInc):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Fantasy Lacrosse 2020 in Review blog series we will dive into the statistical details of PLL Championship Series to determine which teams, position groups and players had the largest impact on the 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse season.

    "text": "2020 PLL Championship Series\nThe PLL made the best of a difficult situation by opting to play a 20 game bubble season in the summer of 2020 called the PLL Championship Series. Thankfully due to the hard work of their staff and players, no positive COVID-19 cases were recorded as a result of the Series. The flexibility and determination of the PLL also allowed fans to enjoy the first season of Fantasy Lacrosse.\nThe 14 games of Group Play featured each of the seven teams playing four games over two weeks. These games served as the “regular season” for the inaugural fantasy lacrosse season. The results of these games are summarized below:\n\nDue to the schedule of the Group Play games, Flow Fantasy elected to split the fantasy season into two slates. The first slate consisted of the 7 games played from July 25th to July 29th, with the second slate consisting of the following 7 games played from July 30th to August 2nd. This division of games was as close to even as possible with most teams playing two games in each slate. However, the Redwoods LC played 3 games in the first slate and the Whipsnakes LC played 3 games in the second slate of games. Fantasy players set separate lineups for each of these slates and we can see from the perfect lineups for each slate how advantageous it was to avoid using players from the Whipsnakes in Slate 1 and the Redwoods in Slate 2.\n  The cumulative total of fantasy points for each slate determined the winner of each fantasy league. League winners were likely cognizant of the matchups each of their players faced in each slate of games and set their lineups in a manner that optimized for the most projected fantasy points. Some factors worth taking into account were the strength of opponent, team playing style and number of games played per slate. A quick look at the Top 20 Fantasy Scorers of the Championship Series shows which players shined in the shortened season.\n\nIn the blog posts to follow in the 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse in Review collection we will analyze the top performers of each team and position group from an overall and per game basis."

Small sample size caveats will apply throughout the analysis presented here and in subsequent posts about the 2020 Fantasy Season. It is also important to state that all data used in this post and in future 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse in Review posts comes directly from Flow Fantasy Inc, who generously provided access through their stats API. As the guys at Flow Fantasy have stated on their Twitter page, they kept independent statistics for each game. Therefore, inconsistencies do exist between the statistics used on their site for scoring purposes and the official PLL statistics. For the exercise of reviewing a specific Fantasy Lacrosse season hosted on by a single site, I felt it was best practice to analyze the official statistics used to score the Fantasy matchups.\nThe team by team and position by position breakdown posts to follow this introduction will aim to provide a comprehensive review of the 2020 PLL Championship Series Group Play games through a statistical and analytic lens in relation to Fantasy Lacrosse. We will explore trends, highlight top performers, examine underachievers and develop lessons learned in order to formulate strategies for Fantasy success in the 2021 season and beyond."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome back to 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse in Review. In this post we will take an in depth look into each PLL Club’s performance in the 2020 PLL Championship series from a Fantasy Lacrosse perspective. If you missed the Introduction to the 2020 Fantasy Lacrosse in Review and Fantasy Lacrosse in general, you can get caught up here.\nRecall that the 2020 Fantasy Season provides us with a small sample size of four games, so all of the analysis here should be taken as a piece of the puzzle but not the full picture. I believe it is important to analyze all the historical data available no matter how small the sample is as long as we keep the context in mind. These four games played in the summer of 2020 were played under extraordinary circumstances and do not define the careers of any player or any team. This is especially important to keep in mind when analyzing a league like the PLL, that is constantly changing and growing year to year with a large amount of player movement through expansion, trades and free agency. Please note all statistical data for this post has been provided in courtesy by Flow Fantasy and their stats API.\nBefore we dive into the details take a quick refresher of the scoring system for the 2020 Flow Fantasy Season:\nWe begin our Club by Club fantasy breakdown by looking at league wide trends to get a sense of the overall picture for the 2020 season.  Looking at the distribution of Total Fantasy Points scored for each PLL Club we see that the Redwoods, Chrome, Archers and Atlas LC’s were relatively even. While the Waterdogs and Whipsnakes LC’s scored a bit more and the Chaos LC scored a bit less Fantasy Points than the middle cluster.\nA closer look at the breakdowns for each statistical scoring category below shows each Club’s strengths and weaknesses.\nWe see that the Waterdogs and Whipsnakes scored about 100 more fantasy points than the middle cluster of Clubs, but took different paths to the top of the scoring chart. The Waterdogs LC thrived on a league leading 115 ground balls, second highest caused turnover total and a strong duo of successful faceoff men. While the Whipsnakes LC shined through their potent offense with league highs in goals and assists with solid performances in all other areas. Turning to the bottom of the chart we see how league lows in goals, assists, and ground balls paired with below average faceoff play hurt the Chaos LC’s fantasy point output.\nThe fantasy point scoring breakdown by position group below shows which areas of the field Clubs excelled in or had trouble producing in:\nA few observations that stick out: the top two Clubs had Faceoff production well above the league average of 58.14. The Whipsnakes Attack unit scored 82 more fantasy points than the next highest unit. The Chrome LC had almost equal fantasy production from their Attack, Midfield and Defensive units.The per game fantasy points by position group shows which units were reliable from game like the Redwoods’ Midfielders, Archer’s Goalies, Whipsnakes’ Attackmen, and Waterdogs Faceoff-men and Defenders. While the Atlas’ Goalies, Redwoods’ Attackmen, Chaos’ Faceoff-men and Midfielders could not be relied on for consistent fantasy production game in and game out.\nIn fantasy sports, we are tasked with identifying matchups that will produce the most fantasy points for the players on our rosters. To maximize our fantasy potential it is important to target players with the highest expected opportunity for statistical success. One strategy is to identify matchups that have high fantasy point totals. This could be the result of a high scoring back and forth type game, a top offense taking advantage of a weaker defense, a blowout followed by some “garbage time” scoring or individual battles that have a history of being dominated by one side. Below we can see the fantasy point totals for each game of the 2020 Fantasy Season.  We see that two of the highest scoring games, Whipsnakes-Archers and Archers-Chrome produced two of the highest fantasy point totals. Then the lowest fantasy point total games came from the lowest scoring game, Redwoods-Chaos and one of the most lopsided games, Chaos-Whipsnakes.\nIn the sections below we will take a deeper look at each Club’s 2020 Fantasy performance. We examine each Club’s style, most and least beneficial matchups, how they stacked up against the league average and positional breakdowns."
